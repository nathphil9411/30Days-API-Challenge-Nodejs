# 30 Days Node.js API Challenge

Are you struggling to get along with Node.js as a begginer? Welcome to the 30 Days Node.js API Challenge repository! This challenge is designed to help you enhance your Node.js skills by building a new API every day for 30 days. This is specifically for growth of beginners. Level up by doing!!.

## How It Works

Each day, you'll tackle a different API project, ranging from basic CRUD operations to advanced integrations with third-party services. The challenge will progressively become more complex, allowing you to gradually expand your knowledge and expertise in Node.js development.

## Getting Started

To get started with the challenge, simply clone this repository and follow the instructions provided in each day's directory. Each project comes with its own README file outlining the requirements, implementation details, and any additional resources you may need.

## Challenge Structure

- _Day 1-10_: Basic to Intermediate APIs (CRUD operations, authentication, file upload)
- _Day 11-20_: Intermediate to Advanced APIs (real-time chat, geolocation, payment integration)
- _Day 21-30_: Advanced APIs and Integrations (machine learning, blockchain, webRTC)

## Resources

Throughout the challenge, you'll be linked with valueable free resources such as tutorials, documentation, and sample code to guide you along the way. Feel free to explore additional topics and experiment with different technologies to personalize your learning experience.

## Share Your Progress

Don't forget to share your progress with the community! You can post updates, ask for help, and engage with fellow participants on social media using the hashtag #NodeAPIChallenge. Let's embark on this coding journey together and see what amazing APIs we can build in 30 days!
